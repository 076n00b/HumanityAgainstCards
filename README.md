HumanityAgainstCards
====================

Shameless rip-off of "Cards Against Humanity".
Began working on this when I wanted to play the game but they were sold out,
and I couldn't be bothered to go make a physical copy, so here we are today.
I don't plan on working on much after release, this is being open sourced because,
1. BY-NC-SA 2.0
2. Maybe someone else will be interested in expanding the game so I can sit back
   and watch the sunset.
